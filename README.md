# Language-translator

Language translators are commonly created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, including interactions with translation APIs.  A popular example of such an API is MyMemory, which can be integrated into these web applications.  Features like "copy" and "speak" buttons can also be implemented using JavaScript and potentially browser APIs or external libraries.
